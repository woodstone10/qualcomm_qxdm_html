# An Efficient Log Analysis with Customized QXDM View

QXDM program is widely used for collecting as well as analyzing of log, generated from Qualcomm modem diagnostic with file format of isf/hdf. 
As QXDM is basically putting messages on show in text format distingused by key, 
it is very powerful to look into specific area closely with corresponding packet. 
However, overall observation using convential QXDM view when is relatively harder 
because an engineer has to find many messages and parameters among distributed packets. 
QXDM extensibility allows users to write their own HTML user views to provide run-time analysis and display of received traffic data, 
so customers can add their own View windows in QXDM with proper HTML programming experience and expertise. 
By making the use of QXDM user html, I have been creating QXDM-based new log analyzer. 
Since it is running on top of QXDM, it allows take advantage of practical use while doing capture a log when you are testing, 
as well as while doing replay a log when you are looking into the log. 
I provides comprehensive tables and instinctive graphs. 
New view will be created upon your request.
